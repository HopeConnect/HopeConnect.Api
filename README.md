Built With HopeConnect: Empowering Change Through Technology

HopeConnect is a platform designed to address urgent issues such as homelessness, hunger, and lack of education faced by millions of people worldwide. The primary goal of this project is to alleviate difficulties in accessing basic needs and provide support to individuals struggling with these issues. To achieve this goal, HopeConnect utilizes various technologies:

ASP.NET Core 8: ASP.NET Core 8 is used to build a robust and reliable backend infrastructure. This ensures the platform operates smoothly and provides users with an efficient experience. Additionally, ASP.NET Core 8's n-layered architecture enables the application to be modular and easily extensible.

Microsoft SQL Server: Microsoft SQL Server is chosen for data storage and processing. This plays a crucial role in ensuring the security and integrity of the platform's data.

Google Cloud Storage: Google Cloud Storage is used for storing and managing files uploaded by users. This enhances the platform's scalability and data accessibility.

Firebase: Firebase integration is employed to enhance user experience and make the platform more accessible. Firebase offers various features such as session management, notifications, and user analytics, thereby increasing the platform's effectiveness.

Google Maps Platform: In addition to the aforementioned technologies, Google Maps Platform is integrated into the project. This provides users with location-based services, facilitating access to local resources. For example, Google Maps Platform is used to display aid points on the map and enable users to access nearby aid resources.

HopeConnect aims to provide users with a secure, accessible, and effective platform for assistance. By integrating these technologies, we believe we are taking a significant step towards bringing about positive change and improvement worldwide.
